## HEE HAW SIREN - PROJECT ONE 
https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/TE-1-31-EXPERIMENTER-DECK

Only the first project is presented in this issue. We advise, however, to purchase the full kit of parts in readiness for the next issue. Keep them in a safe place. The complete circuit may look complex but each individual project is simple.  A Hee Haw siren reminds us of police, fire and ambulance. The idea of emitting two different notes is not new. Its effectiveness in alerting our attention is well known. Take, for instance, a simple two tone door bell or the telephone bell. They are considerably more alerting than a constantly ringing bell because a continuous note tends to blend in with the background noise. However a constantly ringing bell on board ship is the most frightening of all as it signifies FIRE! This project uses a single IC to give two tones. A transistor amplifies this to drive a speaker. The resulting HEE HAW can be adjusted via two mini trim pots to sound just like a fire truck or re-adjusted to sound like a computer gone wild.
